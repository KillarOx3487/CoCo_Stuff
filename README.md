This is a arduino .ino file I created to allow a PS/2 Keyboard to be connected to a CoCo (TRS-80 Color Computer).
This wil work on all CoCo's 1,2 or 3.
This is accomplished by connecting a PS/2 keboard to an arduino, and then connecting the arduino to an MT8808AE-IC, an from the IC to the CoCo factory keboard connector.

I created this to fulfill a void in the CoCo community that everyone was wanting, but no one was providing.
There are a lot of YouTube vidoes showing that this was possible, but nothing realy explaning how it was done, so I sat down one weekend and did it.
I am by no means a professonal programmer, but do love to program, so it might be sloppy to some, but it works!
This is a work in progress. I will be updating as needed or possibly as reqeusted. I am always open to any criticism, positive or negative, that the community my have.
Or any input to improve this project.

I will be adding USB support to this project in the future currently A "USB to PS/2" Addaper is not supported.
